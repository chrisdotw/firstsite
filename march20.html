  <h1>March 20</h1>
  <hr>
<p>I would post a lot of things about what has happened in the last 24 hours, but I've been doing more learning and applying what I've learnt in the other links on my homepage.</p>
<p>Singpore airport was great. I tried to see as many things as I could but still no time. I took plenty of videos and I may apply it here, if I have the motivation. Right now I am more motivated in learning than writing up a personal blog. The layover was 20 hours and we found a good spot to snooze, a flat chair. But then some dickhead comes along and takes one of our spots. The rudest person with no sympathy and I was so mad. I felt so hopeless and powerless since I was in a strict country.</p>
<p>I am coming to the end of my HTML lessons and I will be applying CSS to style the page. I think I will keep the HTML pages as is so I can see my progress throughout time. Like a learning capsule. But I still need to practice to make sure I understand what I am doing. </p>
