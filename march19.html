  <p>So you've noticed I have not put any bullet points listing what I've done today right? That's because I have done enough lessons on HTML to know how to make dot points. <ul>
      <li>Like so.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>The reason was to pretty much learn and I am following Angela Yu's course on Web development and this is one of the modules I must complete. Anyway moving on today is March 19, 2020. Our flight to Singapore is at 10am so we left to go to the
    airport at 6am thinking we needed time due to road closures. <strong>WRONG!</strong> </p>
  <p>

  </p><strong>HOORAY FOR PHOTOS! </strong>The roads were open and the streets were dead. Instead of taking us 90 minutes to get to the airport, it took us a mere 18 minutes! Manila is a ghost town.</p>
  <img srcset="images/march19/hazmat.jpg 20x" alt="tourists outside NAIA in protective clothing">

  <p>We arrived at Terminal 1 NAIA and I can tell you it was very busy and understaffed. I also noticed quite a few people in full jump suits and glasses masks you name it. Overboard? Sure. But they're doing their part to not spread the virus. And an
    airplane is probably the easiest way to catch a virus.</p>
  <p>(I can't wait to do formatting and CSS). So we got our boarding passes and went to our boarding gate thinking it was going to be a busy flight. Think again.</p>

  <p>SCOOT Airlines MNL > SNG. It was such a wierd feeling going heading onto a plane knowing only like 5 people will be boarding.</p>
  <img srcset="images/march19/plane.jpg 20x" alt="scoot aircraft ready to take passengers">
  <p>What's crazy is that everyone boarding this flight must self isolate for a period of 14 days, regardless if they will be disembarking from Singapore or Melbourne. Both countries require mandatory 14 day quarantine.</p>
