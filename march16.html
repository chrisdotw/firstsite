    <li>I am currently at Shakeys Mandaluyong</li>
    <ul>
      <li>Manila in total lockdown aka <em><strong><a href="https://www.cnnphilippines.com/videos/2020/3/17/-Enhanced-Community-Quarantine--takes-effect-in-Luzon.html">Enhanced Community Quaurantine</a></strong></em></li>

      <ul>
        <li>Booked my flight to come here prior to the lockdown, and the news keeps getting worse.</li>
        <li>There is an 8pm curphew and very strict rules that need to be followed.</li>
        <li>Heard that a total lockdown will soon take effect meaning public transportation won't operate and businesses will need to close down.</li>

  <p>Today in the morning we were called by reception at the hotel I was staying in Guadalupe that they are closing their hotel and I needed to be transferred. A bit annoying but what can you do? There's a lockdown and all businesses are shutting
    their doors. They transferred us to ZEN Rooms in Mandaluyong. It was a nice upgrade and a good view of the city. But there was no Wi-Fi and I needed to study, and Kath needed to work! So we headed to Shakeys down the road and spent the next 5
    days there punching away at our keyboards whilst clearing their menu one by one.</p>
