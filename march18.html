  <ul>
    <li>Last day in the Philippines and even more crazy news.</li>
    <ol type="i">
      <li>Whilst staying in Michaels condo, new reports stated that our barangay was in "extreme enhanced community quarantine" which meant no one in or out.</li>
      <li>Packed our stuff and decided to head to Marikina just before that took effect.</li>

  <p>So have you noticed the way I've been typing up my blogs? I know it's pretty boring but as each day progresses my style of writing slightly changes. And part of that is because I'm adding more, or updating previous days, and I am learning new
    coding techniques. So you notice theres a breakline in between this and the dot points above? Yeah, I wrote those dot points on that specific day but I am updating this part on the 19th March 2020, on an airplane bound to Singapore.</p>
  <p>I am keeping it pretty simple, I might add photos here and there once I learn how to. I'm currently only using breaklines and paragraphs as that's all I know pretty much. Anyway let's talk about this day.</p>
  <p>So the condo I stayed in is just a small studio room. There were 5 of us sleeping in the room. Pretty cramped right? And the lockdown got us doing nothing. Nothing at all. In fact I couldn't study properly due to the fact that there wasn't
    enough space and my back would start aching and *hiney* would ache due to the chair being so hard.</p>
  <p>Anyway, I went for a peaceful walk down E Rod Ave. About 30 minutes, or 2.5KM walk. Shortly after returning back to the condo I studied for an hour before falling asleep.</p>
  <p>I woke up to the sound of Sunshine and Cat talking about how they have upgraded the lockdown to an "extreme enhanced community quarantine", whatever that means. Anyway I had my doubts and did some fact checking on a few websites to find out that
    other reputable sources (Rappler, GMA, Manila Bulletin) had confirmed that this was the case and the lockdown meant no one in or out of a particular area. That area being the 200m stretch of road that the condo was conveniently located.</p>
  <p>I tried booking other hotels online but to no avail. Eventually we decided to just head to Marikina and stay the night at Sunshine's grandfathers house. It had Wi-Fi and space to work in private. Sweet.</p>
  <hr>
  <p>There is not much I have learnt today except just the basic breaklines and paragraphs. I learnt how to put photos on and link other web pages but since I don't have internet at the moment I am unable to continue studying.</p>
