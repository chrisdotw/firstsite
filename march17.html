  <p>Today was a really shit day. I was feeling down and I was stressing out. Public transportation was put to a halt and I had no way of getting back to my hostel in Makati unless we walked. So we did.</p>
  <p>Kath and I walked from Mandaluyong to Makati, taking a pedicab and a tricycle along the way. Honestly it was not that bad if it weren't for me hauling this 15kg piece of luggage across the jagged pavement.
    After about 45 minutes we made it to my hostel in Poblacion, Makati, but we were faced with another issue. Kath had no way of getting home, due to the lockdown and tight restrictions coming in and out of NCR. We ended up joining a Facebook group
    and booked a motorbike to take Kath to Ortigas, where her father picked her up and they cleared the checkpoint to get home.</p>
  <p>Now, you thought it was over? Nope. I had to sort myself too and find a way of getting to the airport on Thursday. Eventually I spoke to Sunshine and organized her cousin-in-law to pick me and my luggage up and head to Cubao where her brother,
    Michael resides. From here I stayed at his condominium overnight.</p>
